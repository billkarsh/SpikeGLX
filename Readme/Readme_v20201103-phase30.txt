SpikeGLX Release v20201103-phase30.

Imec API at v3.31.


IMPORTANT
---------

[[ DO NOT DETECT OR RUN UNTIL YOU HAVE UPDATED YOUR MODULE FIRMWARE!! ]]

- Start SpikeGLX 3.0 and use the 'Tools/Update Imec Firmware' command.
- Read the help document in that dialog ('?' in titlebar).
- Select the files included in this release's 'Firmware' folder.
- Power cycle everything, that is, shut everything off, wait a few seconds, then turn on again.
- Now you can run.


Current release highlights
--------------------------

- SpikeGLX 3.0 replaces all previous versions.

- This version fixes the firmware updating dialog: it allowed 'Update' to be clicked twice and allowed quitting before updating completed.

- It runs any mix of these probes {1.0, 2.0, NHP, UHD}.

- The current version, adds support for NP1010 and NP1100 probes.

- The Imec Devices table in the Configure dialog always has two entries per module port. This is to accommodate the two docks in each 2.0 headstage. When using anything that isn't a 2.0 part, always check the box for Dock 1 in the table.


Critical release notes
----------------------

- Using SpikeGLX will be very familiar if you used NP 1.0 (any prior version).

- For 2.0 headstages, Dock 1 is on the side of the HS with two large capacitors and the Omnetics connector. Dock 2 is on the label side (flatter contour). You can use either dock or both.

- The Imec API is incomplete in a few respects. Of special note:

- The BIST (probe health tests) all function for 1.0-like probes. For 2.0 probes, the {heartbeat, signal, noise} tests are not implemented.

- The Noise BIST for 1.0-like probes has a peculiarity. If the test is successful the report says so, no problem. However, if the noise test fails, it really has failed...but the reason for the failure that is quoted in the report is wrong. The reason tends to say something about a firmware version issue, but this text string is faulty and should be ignored.

- The HST (HS health tests) do not function yet. Do not use the headstage tester dongles at this time.

- As always, you should calibrate your HS sample clock rates. These are stored in SpikeGLX using the HS serial number as the key because this a measurement about that particular part. However, imec did not include an EEPROM chip on the early-model 2.0 HS so the HS does not know its own serial number. SpikeGLX will require you to type the serial number into a dialog when you click Detect. You need to have read that from the label on the HS. This was corrected for later 2.0 headstages and the serial numbers are read for later HS automatically.

- The IMRO editor dialogs will eventually get a good tool set for selecting which electrodes to connect and which references to use. However, for now we load preset table files for 2.0 probes.

- A set of useful table files for 2.0 is included, as well as MATLAB code to let you make others. This is in folder 'IMRO_Tables' at the top level of the release.


If You've Already Used Imec Probes...
-------------------------------------

This release supports all current probes (NOT phase3A). The look and feel of the software and hardware for all phases are quite similar, making it all the more important to recognize that there are key differences:

<< BEWARE!! >>
The ZIF connector on the 1.0 and 2.0 headstage (HS) works oppositely from 3A:
- In 3A you gently closed the black ZIF tab by pressing down toward the probe.
- In 1.0 and 2.0, insert the probe and press the black tab back toward the headstage.


[ Calibration Files ]
Unlike phase3A probes, the later probes do not contain ADC and gain calibration tables in their EEPROM chips. Rather, for each probe, you need to find its matching folder of calibration data and copy it into your 'SpikeGLX/_Calibration' folder. A calibration folder is named with the serial number of its probe (as printed on the probe flex cable). These folders are available from whoever shipped you the probes.


-------------------------
Deployment / Installation
-------------------------

Basically, download a zip file and extract the whole folder 'Release_vXXX' to the C:\ drive.

However, we recommend that you manually create a folder on the C:\ drive -- 'C:\SpikeGLX\' as a master SpikeGLX folder that will hold one or more downloaded software versions. As many versions as desired can live side by side in the folder. Manually create a desktop shortcut pointing just to the version you currently like (usually the latest). The rationale for this is you can readily revert to an older version (just by changing the shortcut) should the latest one have a bug or an incompatibility with your current experiment setup.

So, your drive should resemble:

C:\SpikeGLX
  Release_v20201103-phase30
  Release_v20200520-phase20
  Release_v20200309-phase20
  Release_v20190413-phase3B1
  ...


---------------
Getting Started
---------------

You are urged to read the included 'UserManual.html' to familiarize yourself with some important concepts.

The other '.html' documents at the top level of the Release folder add specialized discussion.

Help and How-To videos are on my downloads page: <https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/>.


-----------------
Launching the App
-----------------

Double-click the SpikeGLX.exe (or SpikeGLX_NISIM.exe) icon...

Your package includes two application versions:

- SpikeGLX.exe:
This is the fully functional version. It can acquire data from imec and from nidq hardware. However, you have to install National Instruments NI-DAQmx driver software to run it. Otherwise, when you try to launch you'll get messages about one or more missing niXXX.dll components. This version is appropriate for the lab computer where you run experiments.

- SpikeGLX_NISIM.exe:
This is the 'simulated nidq' version. It can acquire real imec data, but it cannot talk to nidq hardware (nor is NI software needed). Rather, if you enable nidq data acquisition (using the Devices Tab of the Config dialog) it will generate simple sine waves on all of the analog channels in the nidq stream. Use this version if you only care about imec probes. Also use this version to open and review existing runs on a laptop where you likely don't have any hardware.
