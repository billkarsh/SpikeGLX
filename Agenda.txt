20160101
--------
- Introduces "multi-trace" MGraph class set and a revised FVW to use, test
and develop that. MGraph is a QGLWidget (or QOpenGLWidget) that draws
unlimited numbers of traces in a vertical stack arrangement. MGraph can
be child of any QWidget, or can be used as the viewport of an MScroll
(subclasses QAbstractScrollArea) as we are in FVW.
- Fix bug: SpikeGLX hangs on remote setTrgEnable command.
- Fix bug: Remote setRunName doesn't handle _g_t tags correctly.
- Data files now get double extension '.nidq.bin', '.nidq.meta'.
- Offline file viewer enabled.

20151231
--------
Function set very close to original SpikeGL. Major UI difference is disabled
fileViewerWindow (FVW) because the model of one GLGraph per channel creates
too many graphics objects. This version is effectively same as "prerelease"
versions distributed around Janelia and elsewhere.


// QT VERSIONS
// ==========================

SpikeGLX builds/runs successfully against following versions, with
noted issues. As of December 2015 all prereleases to Janelia and to

                    "External WM_DESTROY received for
                    QWidgetWindow(0x4b954c40, name="ExportDialogWindow"),
                    parent:  QWindow(0x0), transient parent:
                    QWidgetWindow(0x4b9549a0, name="FileViewerWindowClassWindow")"
                - 12/28/2015: Not yet built 64-bit against NI-DAQ.

// **
// BK: Suspicious change here:
// C:\Qt\5.3\Src\qtwebkit\Source\WebCore\rendering\...
// ...RenderBlockLineLayout.cpp::CheckMidpoints() ; line 426


// ISSUES
// ==========================

- I use pandoc to translate markdown to html help text. I use:
    > pandoc --self-contained -s- c pandoc.css ...
which directly encodes css and img src data into tags like this:
    <link href="data:text/css;charset=utf-8,...thedata..."
The problem is that the html parser used in QTextBrowser does not
understand refs that directly encode data without a filename, so when
running under the Creator environment the Application Output pane logs:
    "QFSFileEngine::open: No file name specified"
for each embedded encoding.


// LOOSE ENDS
// ==========================

- Remote queries about dataFile objects are ill-advised or
(better?) forbidden.


// DOCUMENTATION
// ==========================

- Revisit all BK: notes.

- More structure docs.

- Review documentation of file formats.

- Note that sanctioned NI devices are the PCI-6133 and the USB-6366.


// UI IMPROVEMENT
// ==========================

-GW TODO:
    - Imec !filter currently adds (AP+LF)...but superposition better.

- IMEC TODO:
    - Imec can be run alone using software or hardware start, or get
        hardware start from nidaq (need to break D0 out from Whisper!).

- Perhaps add more windows {ShankView} to layout?

- Save/load parameter sets by name (also remotely). Perhaps a single
file or package? Perhaps a master catalog file pointing to others?

- Consider not just a command set for software but a script capability
to better handle timing among features/functions.


// NEW FEATURES
// ==========================

- Lee group asks for specified channel to act as reference for all others.

- Brian asks for FVW to output measurements like FFT or RMS on each channel.
Perhaps add an Analysis menu.

- GateCtl gets more modes?

- GateCtl should provide option to put acq hardware resets on gate
lo-hi and hi-lo edges. This is to counter analog intan saturation.

- Should allow configuring user digital-out on threshold crosses, like
evt saving modes with {aiChan, doChan, thresh, W, duration, indef}.

- Joao Couto suggests it could be nice to have offline viewer play back
recorded file at true speed, and, to allow remote interface to fetch data
for development simulations.

- Jeremy Cohen suggest two interesting trigger modes:
(1) Rate trigger (to detect activity periods w/ chronic implants) wherein
recording starts (perievtwindow) iff x-percent of given channel subset is
firing with rate > R.

(2) Ripple mode (sharp waves) wherein recording starts (perievtwindow)
iff x-percent of given channel subset is firing (not necessarily at a high
rate, but...) within a time window of width W.

- Consider HDF5 file format.


// MISC NOTES
// ==========================

- Compiling with C++11:
    - Try CONFIG += c++11
    - Try QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -std=c++11

- Pixmap (xpm) editing notes:
(1) Copy existing .xpm to linux.
(2) Open .xpm in Inkscape, edit/save as .svg.
(3) Open .svg in GIMP, save as xpm.
(4) Open .xpm in kwrite, change array type to 'static const char * const'.

- Typical/high aux channel usage might be 6-12 analog in, 16 digital in.

- Use CniAcqDmx to monitor load. If nWhole count increasing beyond expected,
save restore states of {graph-pause, AO-enable}. This may help on systems
with fewer cores.

- Thread count is main load and best hardware is probably quad+ core.
As always, higher clock rate is better. Next issue is spooling data to
same disk as main OS activities. Better to have dedicated data drive.

- Nice test for cursor in window frame:
//    if( mywindow->frameGeometry().contains( QCursor::pos() )
//        && !mywindow->geometry().contains( QCursor::pos() ) ) {
//
//        // do something
//    }
