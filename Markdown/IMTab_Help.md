## Imec Probe (IM) Tab

**In brief: Detailed settings for each probe.**

On the `Devices` tab you checked the `enable` boxes for the probes you want
to run and then clicked `Detect`.

Use this tab to configure parameters for each probe, individually.

--------

## All Probes

A few settings are common to all the probes...

### Calibration Policy

Select how the imec-provided ADC and gain calibration files for each
probe are handled:

* Absolutely required.
* Used if you have that probe's files, skipped otherwise.
* Skipped for all probes.

### Low Latency Mode

This mode runs the probe (and Obx ADC) sample fetching loop faster,
which reduces the time to get fresh data. However, this drives the
CPU 50%+ harder and reduces the maximum number of probes you can safely
run concurrently. Pay attention to the Metrics Window and Task Manager
Performance readouts to make sure your runs are stable under load.

### Acquisition Start Signal

Currently we are only supporting software-based initiation of imec data
streaming. That is, the data acquisition starts manually when you click
the `Run` button in the configuration dialog.

### Survey all probe banks

To do a run that is automatically customized for whole-probe surveys:

- Check the box in this item group.
- Select the number of seconds to allow probes to settle when run starts;
(this is added to the recording time of the first bank).
- Select the number of seconds to record in each bank.

The entire surface of each selected probe will be sampled:
shank-0:[bank-0..bank-max], shank-1:[bank-0..bank-max], etc.

>*NXT probes use a block pattern covering them with fewest steps.*

Although the survey controls the selected sites (looping over shanks and
banks), it adopts the reference, gain, and highpass filter settings set
in each probe's current IMRO table. That is, you can thus choose to do
the survey with external or tip referencing by setting that choice for
each probe in the IMRO editor.

A survey run will save data files to the current run directory
specified on the `Save tab`. The files will automatically be named
`SvyPrb_date&time_g0_t0...`

One (bin/meta) file-pair is saved for each probe. Within a file the
sampling blocks are end-to-end. Open these files with the File Viewer
(Ctrl-O) and open the Shank Viewer. As you scroll through the file the
Shank Viewer shows the current probe region.

If enabled the sync waveform and/or the nidq stream are also recorded
during a survey run. Using the linking feature of the File Viewer you
can view probe activity with concurrent trigger events such as neural
stimulations. These features enable you to program the most relevant
regions of interest into the IMRO tables.

Note that the time to program a new bank plus amplifier settle time is
about 2 to 3 seconds. You'll definitely see these transition regions as
you browse the data.

#### Max bank

In this mode all channels are saved, so the `Save chans` table column
instead becomes `Max bank`. Use this item to skip sampling banks that
are out of the brain.

### Filtered Streams

As of SpikeGLX version 20230425, you can set up a filtered probe AP-band
stream that runs in parallel with the raw stream. You can set the bandpass
edges for this stream, and the stream automatically gets global `demux` CAR.
These data, when present, are used to improve signal-to-background in both
audio output and Shank Viewers (for {spike, AP pk-pk} calculations). There
is a checkbox to disable this feature just in case you are running out of
RAM or CPU, but we don't think this will be necessary unless you are
concurrently running as many as (12) 384-channel, or, (3) 1536-channel
probes. It's a good idea to look at the Metrics Window for any signs of
instability.

> A filtered stream will auto-disable for a few seconds if the system is
overstressed. When that happens, the filtered data are replaced by zeros,
hence, ShankViews will appear black and audio will shut off.

--------

## Probe Database

SpikeGLX maintains a database of probe settings in the _Calibration folder.
The settings are keyed to the probe's serial number. There is one entry per
probe, hence, the software remembers the last thing you did with that probe.
The entries are each time-stamped. Individual entries are discarded after
three years of disuse.

When you click `Detect` we look for each selected probe in the database.
If found, the stored settings are used. If no entry is found, the probe
gets default settings.

You can always see and edit those settings using the `Each probe` table
on the `IM Setup` tab.

Upon clicking `Verify` or `Run` the table values are transferred to the
database for future runs.

--------

## Table Viewing and Sizing

* The probe table scrolls!
* Resize columns by clicking on the dividers between column headers.
* Double-click on a divider to auto-size that column.
* Drag the `Configure` dialog's outer edges or corners to resize all content.

--------

## Editing

* Select a table row, then click `Default`, or,
* **Double-click** in a table cell to edit that item.

For each probe, you can edit its:

* LED (really, for each headstage).
* IMRO table.
* Bad (stand-by) channels.
* Channel map.
* Save channels.

More details below.

--------

## Measured Sample Rate

Not editable.

This is the probe's (headstage's) measured sample rate as determined by the
calibration procedures on the `Sync` tab (See User Manual).

--------

## LED

One checkbox per probe, but really the LEDs are on headstages...

* NP 1.0-type probes: One probe per headstage: no conflicts.
* NP 2.0-type probes: Two probes per headstage: requires your thought.

When you click `Verify` or `Run` you will be warned if your LED
settings for the same headstage conflict.

--------

## IMRO Table

Use the [graphical IMRO editor](ShankView_Help.html#edit-tab-quick-reference)
to select:

* Regions of interest ("boxes").
* Which reference to use (external, tip).
* AP and LF gains and filters (where applicable).

--------

## Bad (Stand-by) Channels

Edit directly in the table cell by specifying a channel list,
just as you do for saved channels. E.g., 0:3,200,301:305.

The probe API lets you turn off the amplifiers for selected channels; what
imec terms setting the channel to stand-by mode. The channel is still read
out but its amplitude will effectively be zero. This makes graph windows
easier to view. There is another more important way we use the bad channel
list...

SpikeGLX and CatGT observe the geometry map that's stored in every recording's
metadata file. A geometry (geom) map describes:

1. Where that channel's electrode is on the probe.
2. Whether that channel should be `used` in spatial averaging (CAR).

When you click `Verify` or `Run`, SpikeGLX updates the probe's geom map.
These channels are set to (used=0):

* On-shank references.
* Listed bad channels.

--------

## Channel Map

This lets you group/sort/order the channels in SpikeGLX graph windows.
It has no effect on how binary data are stored.

--------

## Save Channels

You can save all of the channels being acquired by setting the list to
any of:

* blank
* '*'
* 'all'

You can save any arbitrary subset of channels using a printer-page-like
list of individual channels and/or ranges, like: 1:200,205,207,350:360.

>The SY channel is always added to your list because it carries error flags
and the sync channel.

### Force LF to Complement Listed AP Channels

(If checked) AND (if this probe type has separate LF channels) THEN your
list of saved channels is edited so that there is a saved LF channel for
each listed AP channel. It's just a convenience.

>The checkbox actually applies to all probes, not just the one being edited.

--------

## Fix Probe ID

This tool allows you to alter the stored serial number and part number
of the selected probe. It is useful when a probe has a faulty EEPROM chip.
The new values that you enter here will be used for this run. However, the
values are not stored, so you will have to use the tool again for each run.

--------

## Default

This is a handy way to set all of the editable fields:

* LED: off.
* IMRO: bank 0, external referencing, medium gain, AP filter on.
* Bad chans: read from the probe database.
* Channel map: ordered from probe tip to base.
* Save chans: all.

--------

## Copy

Select a probe and copy its settings to a specified other probe, or to all
other probes.

* This only acts between probes of the same `type`.
* This does NOT copy `measured sample rates`.
* This does NOT copy `bad chans`.
