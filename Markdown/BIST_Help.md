## Overview

A number of self tests are implemented in the recording system to
debug combinations of subsystems.

The signal and noise tests are qualitative; see the 'Noncritical Failures'
section for better ways to evaluate probe performance.

## The Tests

### Base Station

This test checks the connectivity between PC and BS FPGA board over the
PXIe interface.

--------

### Heartbeat

The heartbeat signal generated by the PSB_SYNC signal of the probe is
routed via the SerDes to the BSC FPGA. The BSC analyzes the presence of
a 1 Hz clock signal.

The presence of a heartbeat signal indicates the functionality of the
power supplies on the HS for serializer and probe, the POR signal, the
presence of the master clock signal on the probe, the functionality of
the clock divider on the probe, and basic communication over the
SerDes link.

--------

### SerDes Link

The functionality of the SerDes link is quantitatively verified
using the integrated PRBS test of the SerDes component pair.

--------

### I2C/Memmap

This test verifies the functionality of the I2C interface and the probe's
memory map. The function reads a register on a memory map address, writes
back a modified value, reads this again, and writes the original value
again to restore the probe to its settings before test.

The test is successful if the modified value can be read back, and if an
‘Ack’ byte has been received for each R/W operation.

--------

### EEPROM

The test verifies the correct access to the EEPROM on flex, HS and BSC.
The function writes data to an unused location on the EEPROM, and reads
it back.

The test is successful if the data can be read back, and if a ‘Ack’ byte
has been received for each R/W operation.

The function tests the flex, HS and BSC EEPROM consecutively. The function
returns an error after the first failed test.

--------

### Shift Registers

This test verifies the functionality of the shank and base shift registers.
The function configures the shift register two times with the same code.
After the 2nd write cycle the SR_OUT_OK bit in the STATUS register is read.
If OK, the shift register configuration was successful. The test is done
for all registers. The configuration code used for the test is a dedicated
code (to make sure the bits are not all 0 or 1).

**If this test fails, a shank is likely broken.**

--------

### Parallel Serial Bus

A test mode is implemented on the probe which enables the transmission
of a known data pattern over the PSB bus. This test records a small data
set and verifies whether that matches the known data pattern.

This way the PSB bus on the probe and all data lines between probe and
serializer are verified.

--------

### Signal Path

The probe is configured for recording of a test signal which is generated
on the HS. This configuration is done via the shank and base configuration
registers and the memory map. The AP data signal is recorded and the
frequency and amplitude of the recorded signal are extracted for each
electrode. If at least 90% of the electrodes show a signal within the
frequency and amplitude tolerance, the function returns a pass value.

> 1. The function requires more than 30 seconds to complete.
>
> 2. This test and the noise test are somewhat qualitative. If all other
tests besides {signal, noise} pass, the probe is probably alright.

--------

### Noise Level

The probe is configured for noise analysis. Via the shank and base
configuration registers and the memory map, the electrode inputs are
shorted to ground. The data signal is recorded and the noise level is
calculated. The function analyses if the probe performance falls
inside a specified tolerance range (go/no-go test).

The probe passes the noise test if fewer than 20% of the electrodes have
their AP noise value out of spec, and if fewer than 20% of the electrodes
have their LFP noise value out of spec.

The function returns a pass/fail value.

> 1. The function requires more than 30 seconds to complete.
>
> 2. This test and the signal path test are somewhat qualitative. If all
other tests besides {signal, noise} pass, the probe is probably alright.

--------

## Critical Failures

These hardware errors may be recoverable by reconnecting or replacing parts.

### Headstage Problems

Bad headstages are exceedingly rare. If you are getting errors like:

```
Error 44 'NO_LINK: No headstage detected on port X'
```

It is probably a poor connection between the probe flex and headstage.
Keep playing with that. Sometimes changing the pairing between probe and
headstage will help because the tiny ZIF connectors are not manufactured
to super tight tolerances and sometimes the ZIF clasp can weaken and fail
to close tightly onto the flex.

The next thing to suspect is a bad 5-meter cable. Sometimes the leads can
wiggle loose inside the Omnetics connectors after many dis/connect cycles.

Finally, while it is very unlikely that the headstage has an electronic
issue, for a 1.0 headstage, you can try running the HST dialog with the
headstage tester dongle.

### Shift Register Error

You should verify the probe is actually broken by trying an alternate
headstage and/or cable. If this problem won't go away...

The shift registers are used to program settings into the probe. Depending
upon how badly damaged the probe is, it might "run," but you have no way of
knowing which electrodes are connected or which references are being used.

Future versions of SpikeGLX/imec firmware may permit the use of a multishank
probe that only has one or two broken shanks, but that is not possible yet.
Do not throw such probes away.

### Parallel Serial Bus Error

This most commonly occurs when the probe flex is not seated well in the
headstage. It will usually clear if you carefully close the clasp on the
ZIF while pushing the flex squarely and firmly into the ZIF all the way.

--------

## Noncritical Failures

### Signal Path Error / Noise Level Error

These two BISTs are somewhat qualitative and oversensitive. If the only
thing wrong is that one or both of these two tests fails, the probe may
well be fine. We suggest manually surveying the probe which will give
you much better information about both the probe and the environment.
Do the following:

**Common Setup**

1. Run the probe in a saline bath with reference and ground connected
together and to a wire placed in the solution with good conductance
(Ag/AgCl, Pt). Immerse deeply so all electrodes are in solution. This
is the same as the input-referred noise setup in the probe 'User Manual.'

2. Select External referencing mode for the probe.

**Assess Probe Internal Noise**

>Do this by applying maximum environment noise filtering: 

3. On the `IM Setup` tab, check `Filtered IM stream buffers`. This causes
the ShankViewer to apply both band-pass filtering and CAR (Gbldmx).

4. In the Graphs Window apply these Settings:

* `Secs`: 0.1
* `Band-pass`: 300-INF
* `-<T>`: ON
* `-<S>`: Gbl Dmx
* `BinMax`: OFF

As you hover the mouse over the traces, observe `stdv` readouts at the
bottom of the Graphs Window (stdv is effectively RMS-offset). Depending
upon probe model, the specs for this are 7-9 uV, but in practice, anything
below 10 uV means the probe is ok. Remember there will always be a handful
of outlier channels.

5. Open the ShankViewer to look at the whole probe. Set the following:

* `Colorize`: AP pk-pk
* `Update`: 0.1 secs
* `Scale`: 100

The AP range should be ~50 uV on this scale. Look at the uniformity of
the value over the probe. Hot (bad) channels will be bright yellow or
white.

You may also see some black (zero) channels. These could be dead, or they
could be saturated. Check that by un/checking the `-<T>` filter as you
observe the trace in the Graphs Window.

In any case bad channels can be masked (see below).

**Assess Environment Noise**

>Do this by applying minimum filtering:

3. On the `IM Setup` tab, un-check `Filtered IM stream buffers`. This causes
the ShankViewer to apply only high-pass filtering.

4. In the Graphs Window apply these Settings:

* `Secs`: 0.1
* `Band-pass`: AP Native (OFF)
* `-<T>`: ON
* `-<S>`: OFF
* `BinMax`: OFF

Now `stdv` readouts will be much larger but that's not a bad probe. It's
your call how much noise pickup is OK. If the noise is greater than 15 uV
you could have a poor connection in the ref or ground wire path. Check
your solder joints.

This is a good time to poke the probe wires with a stick. Also poke the
flex connector. The signals should be quite steady under poking. If the
noise bounces when you poke then something is too loose.

Of course all environments will have their own noise sources. Very large
environment noise could come from any equipment in your building. Try
plugging your electronics into different wall sockets (maybe different
building circuits). Note if it tracks the building air conditioning
schedule. Is it worse at a certain time of day? Consider a Faraday cage.

### Bad Channels

It is common that three or four channels on the probe have overly large
noise or variation in amplitude. If a few channels look bad but the other
channels look normal, then use the probe, but list its bad channels as
such in the `Each probe` table on the `IM Setup` tab. This will mask them
from use in CAR within SpikeGLX, CatGT and Jennifer Colonell's ecephys
pipeline.
