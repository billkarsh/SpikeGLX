Get compiled apps, support and help stuff on this page. See what's new on the site here . The source code repo is here . This site supports prototype and currently shipping commercial products. The latest commercial PXI-based components are: Hardware: Neuropixels 1.0, 2.0, NHP, UHD, Quad-base . Software: SpikeGLX API4 . What Is SpikeGLX? SpikeGLX is a recording system for extracellular neural probes. The emphasis is on concurrent synchronous recording from high channel count probes together with numerous auxiliary analog and digital channels: Concurrent, synchronized acquisition from imec probes, OneBoxes and NI-DAQ devices. Supports all Neuropixels probe generations and types. Supports HHMI/Whisper system. Integration with live anatomical tracking: Pinpoint ; Trajectory Explorer . Flexible visualization, filtering and sorting tools. Programmable triggering. Remote control and extensibility via MATLAB, C++, C, C#, Python. Powerful offline viewing and editing. In addition to the SpikeGLX acquisition application, we provide a large complement of post-processing tools that are also found on this page. Our tool set is maintained and updated in lock step with SpikeGLX to make sure the tools work together correctly and have full awareness of all the flexibility that SpikeGLX provides in selecting parameters and making custom output files. Note: If you want to craft your own post-processing tools, we strongly advise that you incorporate or at least consult the metadata parsing methods we have provided for both Python and MATLAB: SpikeGLX_Datafile_Tools . System Requirements (What to Buy) Requirements differ according to platform: For PXI or OneBox setups . For earlier (Xilinx) setups . OneBox Notes: Imec began selling OneBoxes October 5, 2024. Get data sheets and submit purchase requests at the Neuropixels site . OneBox does not depend upon any PXI hardware, hence, it does not require enclustra drivers. Important!: The enclustra drivers required for PXI do not work with AMD-based computers. The PXI-based imec hardware can only run on computers using Intel CPUs and chipsets. Important!: Older imec modules (shipped before Q2 2023) are programmed to work only in X4 and higher chassis slots. Learn more about this issue on the site's Firmware tab .

Has many GUI enhancements and better help. Important: Please read the README file in your download. Release 20250915-api4 ... Readme : Quadbase, API4, Qt6, api v4.1.3 Release downloads come with two executables : SpikeGLX.exe : Runs {imec probes, OneBox, NI, FileViewer}, but you need to install NI drivers to run it . SpikeGLX_NISIM.exe : Runs {imec probes, OneBox, FileViewer} but not NI hardware. Does not need NI drivers . Use this on your laptop to review data and plan new runs. Suggested organization: Create folder 'SpikeGLX' on your desktop or C:\\ then download/unzip associated stuff into it. It's fine to have several versions there as long as you run one at a time: SpikeGLX\\ Release_v20250915-api4.zip Release_v20250325-phase30.zip Release_v20250915-api4\\ Release_v20250325-phase30\\ Drivers\\ Enclustra_Windows_10&11\\ Tools\\ Etc.\\ PXI Enclustra Drivers These required driver files are not included in your SpikeGLX release. Click the link below for your Windows OS version. Unzip the folder into your local folder of SpikeGLX-related stuff. Follow the installation ReadMe in the download. Terminology: 'Enclustra' is a company that markets other vendor's FPGAs along with development and support tools. There are several FPGAs used in the Neuropixels hardware, including a Xilinx Zynq model, often referred to as 'the enclustra'. Windows 7 & 8 Windows 10 & 11 Important!: The enclustra drivers required for PXI do not work with AMD-based computers. The PXI-based imec hardware can only run on computers using Intel CPUs and chipsets. Remote Control/Scripting SDK Note: SDK = Software Development Kit API = Application Programming Interface SpikeGLX can be driven in real time by your own remote Windows or Linux application. The API uses the TCP/IP protocol. Your custom application can run on a separate computer (on the same network as SpikeGLX) or on the same computer. The API allows you to: Set/get parameters. Start/stop runs. Fetch data with low latency (<4 ms on same computer). Do many things you can do from the SpikeGLX GUI. There are two SDKs: SpikeGLX-MATLAB-SDK : For MATLAB programs. SpikeGLX-CPP-SDK : For C++, C, C#, Python. Get these at the source code repo here . HelloSGLX (Windows) The above SDKs are full featured and support developers writing in MATLAB, C++, C, C# and Python. If you are writing in anything else, you can use HelloSGLX instead. This is a command-line application that stands in between your script and SpikeGLX. For each command or query, your script uses its shell commands to launch HelloSGLX as a separate process. This is too slow for real-time data interaction, but still supports easy integration of SpikeGLX into an automated workflow. You can get/set run parameters and start/stop runs and file writing. Get it here . Note that all of these SDKs require SpikeGLX 20220101 or later. Command-line Tool Installation CatGT TPrime NIScaler C_Waves OverStrike These come as zip files. To install one: Extract the contained folder to any destination you like. Keep the folder contents together, as you do with the SpikeGLX folder. Read the contained ReadMe.txt for instructions. Look at the runit.bat example batch script. CatGT CatGT is a command-line tool that does the following offline operations on SpikeGLX output files (all probe types): Optionally join trials with given run_name and index ranges [ga,gb] [ta,tb]... ...Or run on any individual file. Optionally apply demultiplexing corrections. Optionally apply band-pass and CAR filters. Optionally edit out saturation artifacts. By default extract tables of sync waveform edge times to drive TPrime. Optionally extract tables of other nonneural event times to be aligned with spikes. Optionally join the above outputs across different runs (supercat feature). CatGT: Tshift, CAR, Gfix CatGT 5.1 (Windows) CatGT 5.1 (Linux) CatGT ReadMe TPrime TPrime is a command-line tool that maps event times (all probe types): Map time from one SpikeGLX data stream to any other.

You get a red module status light; the module isn't recognized at all... It could be a 1-lane ( X1 ) slot. In February 2022 we've encountered the fact that not all PXIe chassis slots are the same with respect to bandwidth. They come in X1, X2, X4, X8, X16, X32. X1 is sufficient for up to 250 MB/s, which is completely adequate for an imec module. However, imec originally designed the module firmware for X4 and higher slots.

There are several branches in this repo tracking major Imec Neuropixels project development phases. The various phases have involved both software and hardware evolution and redesign, so obtain the appropriate materials for your needs. Release software packages are labeled as phase3A, phase3B1, phase3B2, phase20, phase30 or phase40. All early releases having no phase label are actually phase3A. All releases support NI-DAQ based acquisition. Summaries of development phases (newest to oldest): API4 : (Main branch) In 2025 Imec introduced API 4.0, which extends support to three technologies (tech): {STD=NP1+NP2, OPTO, NXT=NP3}. There are three corresponding PXI basestation-module techs which will each need specific firmware. The SpikeGLX 'Upload Firmware' dialog will help manage this. OneBox is considered a STD-tech module. Existing modules and OneBox remain compatible with API4. There are rules about which probe-tech runs in which module-tech. SpikeGLX API4 supports all tech and will guide you accordingly. SpikeGLX now builds with Qt 6.9 rather than Qt 5.12, which slightly alters its appearance. Phase30 : This is unified software to support Neuropixels 1.0, 2.0 and all probe hardware produced through 8/1/2025. Again, the same base station modules can be used after updating their firmware, which can be done via SpikeGLX. This version also supports OneBox. Phase20 : A.k.a. Neuropixels 2.0, introduces specific probes and HS with a more compact design. The HS each support two probes. The same PXIe modules can be used with a firmware update. SpikeGLX for this phase is specific to 2.0 hardware. Phase3B2 : A.k.a. Neuropixels 1.0. This phase replaces the Xilinx board with PXIe based modules, each of which connects up to 4 probes. Several modules can be operated together from one PXI chassis and one application. The probes are the same as phase3B1, but all other hardware parts are specific to the PXIe implementation. Phase3B1 : At this phase, option 3 probes from phase3A were selected for further development and commercial production. The same Xilinx board is retained for one at a time probe operation over Ethernet (but reprogrammed for 3B1). The cables, HS and BSC parts are all specific to 3B1. The 3B probes can be run with either 3B1 or 3B2 setups. Phase3A : Initially, 4 flavors of prototype probe (option 1, 2, 3, 4) were created enabling founding consortium members to choose the most useful architecture and feature set. Phase3A probes are connected one at a time to a Xilinx Kintex 7 FPGA board, and accessed via Ethernet. The probes, cables, HS and BSC parts are specific to phase3A.

There are several branches in this repo tracking major Imec Neuropixels project development phases. The various phases have involved both software and hardware evolution and redesign, so obtain the appropriate materials for your needs. Release software packages are labeled as phase3A, phase3B1, phase3B2, phase20, phase30 or phase40. All early releases having no phase label are actually phase3A. All releases support NI-DAQ based acquisition. Summaries of development phases (newest to oldest): API4 : (Main branch) In 2025 Imec introduced API 4.0, which extends support to three technologies (tech): {STD=NP1+NP2, OPTO, NXT=NP3}. There are three corresponding PXI basestation-module techs which will each need specific firmware. The SpikeGLX 'Upload Firmware' dialog will help manage this. OneBox is considered a STD-tech module. Existing modules and OneBox remain compatible with API4. There are rules about which probe-tech runs in which module-tech. SpikeGLX API4 supports all tech and will guide you accordingly. SpikeGLX now builds with Qt 6.9 rather than Qt 5.12, which slightly alters its appearance. Phase30 : This is unified software to support Neuropixels 1.0, 2.0 and all probe hardware produced through 8/1/2025. Again, the same base station modules can be used after updating their firmware, which can be done via SpikeGLX. This version also supports OneBox. Phase20 : A.k.a. Neuropixels 2.0, introduces specific probes and HS with a more compact design. The HS each support two probes. The same PXIe modules can be used with a firmware update. SpikeGLX for this phase is specific to 2.0 hardware. Phase3B2 : A.k.a. Neuropixels 1.0. This phase replaces the Xilinx board with PXIe based modules, each of which connects up to 4 probes. Several modules can be operated together from one PXI chassis and one application. The probes are the same as phase3B1, but all other hardware parts are specific to the PXIe implementation. Phase3B1 : At this phase, option 3 probes from phase3A were selected for further development and commercial production. The same Xilinx board is retained for one at a time probe operation over Ethernet (but reprogrammed for 3B1). The cables, HS and BSC parts are all specific to 3B1. The 3B probes can be run with either 3B1 or 3B2 setups. Phase3A : Initially, 4 flavors of prototype probe (option 1, 2, 3, 4) were created enabling founding consortium members to choose the most useful architecture and feature set. Phase3A probes are connected one at a time to a Xilinx Kintex 7 FPGA board, and accessed via Ethernet. The probes, cables, HS and BSC parts are specific to phase3A.","title":"Imec Project Phases"},{"location":"legacy/#older-versions","text":"30 : Release 20250325-phase30 ...

This note covers what they are and how to use them. The Ground Line Always Connect To CSF. This is an extension of the basestation's wall ground. However, because the ground runs through a 5-meter, thin wire, the probe ground is about +650 mV higher than wall ground. This sets the ground level for the probe's base circuits that sample, amplify, filter, digitize and transmit neural signals. Generally the subject should be grounded, whether an animal or buffer, for these reasons: Damage : If the subject is floating and holding a static charge, the probe could get zapped and damaged. Saturation : If subject potential is far from that of the electronics, the amplifiers can saturate. The reading are then unusable. Moreover, the amplifiers can sometimes lock into saturation until restarted, which wastes time. Noise reduction : Connecting the subject to ground reduces its ability to act as an antenna. Although the differential nature of the measurements acts to cancel common noise, it's better to drain the noise to ground before it ever gets to the amplifiers. In summary, always ground the animal: run a wire from the ground terminal of the probe flex to the animal CSF, either via a pin through the skull into CSF, or placed in the saline in the craniotomy. IMPORTANT: The probe ground should be the ONLY ground connection to the animal. Otherwise you'll make ground loops which are noise antennas. For self-referenced noise measurements in a bath, we also recommend connecting probe ground to the bath to act as a noise drain. This is a better measurement of the probe's own internal electronics noise. It's also more similar to an animal ground configuration. It is highly recommended to do self-referenced noise measurements one-probe-at-a-time to prevent any possibility of multiple probes interacting with each other. The Reference Line Flexibility: Depends On Needs. All imec probes are designed for differential measurements. The electrode sites connect to (+) amplifier inputs, and the selected reference level connects to the (-) inputs. The benefit of differential measurement is common mode noise rejection. This only works if the reference is connected to the animal . The system supports a variety of reference configurations to meet your needs: External : Select External in software (in the IMRO editor ), and connect the probe's reference terminal to any desired point. That could be the bath in a noise measurement setup, the animal CSF, or a second wire in the brain, far from the imec probe. BTW, external is the default option . Ground : Some probes (mainly 2.0) offer a software option for Ground referencing. This internally connects the (-) amplifier inputs to circuit ground. Using this mode, you can make measurements relative to ground without soldering a wire to the probe's reference terminal. If your probe doesn't support the software Ground option, you can select External and solder a wire from the reference terminal to the animal as above. BTW, because the ground line is connected to the animal, this mode is still a differential measurement retaining a useful degree of common mode rejection . Tip : This internally connects the given shank tip electrode to the (-) inputs. As with the Ground option, this does not require any wire to be connected to the reference terminal on the flex. Pro tip : A tiny internal switch is used to connect the (-) amplifier input to the selected reference. Only the External mode requires a wire from the reference terminal on the flex to some point in the brain. In any other mode, having a reference wire connected is OK, but it isn't doing anything valuable. The ideal practice is to omit the reference wire entirely to minimize crosstalk from that terminal, across the switch. The worst thing is to connect a long free wire to the reference terminal, making a noise antenna. Standard Practice For Spikes The most important thing for referencing in spike measurement is low noise. There isn't a rule about what reference to use or where to put wires. For AP band it probably doesn't make a lot of difference where you reference. Different choices will differ from each other primarily in DC offset, and hopefully lowish frequencies, and that will be removed by the band-pass and CAR filters you'll use in postprocessing. So what does everyone else do? It's helpful to allow a main and a backup option, and have the convenience of a single extra wire coming off the probe. The wiring part of the strategy depends on probe model: 2.0 with Ground Option : Connect one wire from the flex ground terminal to the CSF. {1.0, NHP, Ultra} w/o Ground Option : Solder the reference and ground terminals together at the flex and run a single wire from there to the CSF. This way you can start with ground referencing, and if the noise is small, you're all set. If it's too noisy, you may have a contaminated ground, so just switch to Tip referencing in software without changing any wires. That may look better. So with this setup you get two chances to get data today, and you can try to get rid of the noise in your lab tomorrow. LFP Measurements Use External or Ground Modes. LFP tends to vary slowly over large areas. Tip referencing may be an especially bad choice: for sites near the tip the differential measurement will cancel signal as well as background, and at the other end of the probe measurements contain (local LFP - tip LFP), so the referencing is inconsistent. Moreover, you'd rather have a larger area electrode for better averaging. Noise To minimize noise use low impedance paths for reference and ground: Do a good job with soldering any and all the wires. Use beefy wires and ground straps where you can. Don't use hacks like alligator clips to connect things. fin","title":"Noise: Reference and Ground"},{"location":"Help/Ref_gnd/#noise-reference-and-ground","text":"","title":"Noise: Reference and Ground"},{"location":"Help/Ref_gnd/#overview","text":"Imec probes have two solder connections: reference and ground.

Gate and trigger indices All files are created under the control of SpikeGLX gate and trigger modes, which determine when to start writing files. When file writing starts, all files for all streams will get tagged by the current g- and t-indices so you know they go together as a set. They will also be grouped together inside a folder that is named with the run name and the current g-index. An important characteristic of all of the files in the same Run_g* folder is that they start writing at the same time. Said another way, they are time-aligned at their starts if you had sync enabled. All of the files from the same run have a special relationship to each other. During a run the settings are held constant and the data continue to stream. The files that are written are just snapshots from the continuous stream. The files contain a metadata item firstSample that identifies where in that continuum this file was snapped. This allow the files saved from the same run to be concatenated in a way that reconstructs the true timeline. The CatGT tool can perform time-preserving join operations. Probe index 3A probe filename has no index number after .imec. , e.g. myrun_g0_t0.imec.ap.meta . All later phases have a probe index, e.g. myrun_g0_t0.imec0.ap.meta . CatGT Tip : Use option -prb_3A for 3A data, and DON'T use -prb=list ! Directories Data directory At the highest level is the data directory which you set in SpikeGLX using menu item Options::Choose Data Directory . All output data will be stored into this directory. Note: You can split data into several top-level directories using the Multidrive Feature . Run folder Version 20190214 and later first create a Run Folder within the data directory. The run folder holds all output from that run, and is named with a g-index, e.g. myrun_g0 . Prior to SpikeGLX version 20190214 there were no run folders. Rather, all datafiles output from a run were placed directly into the current Data Directory . CatGT Tip : Use option -no_run_fld for runs before version 20190214. Probe folders Xilinx-based 3A, 3B1 These phases are single-probe. No option for probe folders is provided. Everything else (3B2, 1.0, 2.0, ...) Version 20190214 and later provide a Folder per probe option on the Save tab: If not selected, no probe folders are created. Rather, all output files for a run are saved into the Run Folder . If selected (checked): All nidq and obx datafiles are saved directly into the Run Folder . A separate Probe Folder for each imec probe is first created in the run folder. The probe folder holds all output from that probe, and is named with both g- and probe-indices, e.g. myrun_g0_imec6 . CatGT Tip : Use option -prb_fld if option selected. Multidrive output Before the multidrive option was introduced SpikeGLX let you specify at most one data directory to hold all your run output folders and files. As of version 20200309 , there is still a main data directory, but now you can check a box to enable the splitting of runs across additional drives/directories to access greater storage capacity when doing very long runs or when using many probes. Modulo rule The rule for distributing run output into several data directories is this: As always, the (N) probes have logical indices [0..N-1] . The main data directory is dir-0 . The set of all (M) directories, including the main one are enumerated [dir-0..dir-M-1] . NI and obx output is always sent to dir-0. Probe-j output is sent to dir-(j modulo M) . Within each dir-k SpikeGLX will create a run folder and applicable probe folders according to the same rules that apply for a single main data directory. A Modulo B means \"take the remainder of dividing integers A/B \". Modulo is often written mod and is written % in C/C++ and Python code. For example, suppose these parameters: dir-0 = D:\\Data dir-1 = E:\\DataB dir-2 = G:\\DataC runname = myRun folder per run is enabled Example output would go here: NI: D:\\Data\\myrun\\myrun_g0_t0.ni.bin(.meta) obx0: D:\\Data\\myrun\\myrun_g0_t0.obx0.obx.bin(.meta) obx1: D:\\Data\\myrun\\myrun_g0_t0.obx1.obx.bin(.meta) Imec0: D:\\Data\\myrun\\myrun_g0_imec0\\myrun_g0_t0.imec0.ap.bin(.meta) Imec3: D:\\Data\\myrun\\myrun_g0_imec3\\myrun_g0_t0.imec3.ap.bin(.meta) Imec4: E:\\DataB\\myrun\\myrun_g0_imec4\\myrun_g0_t0.imec4.ap.bin(.meta) Imec8: G:\\DataC\\myrun\\myrun_g0_imec8\\myrun_g0_t0.imec8.ap.bin(.meta) Note: You can run several OneBox ADC streams, which would be named 'obx0,' 'obx1,' etc. All obx* data are tiny so we put all obx files in the main dir-0 directory. New offline behaviors When multidrive output is enabled, a run's files are distributed over several directories. The SpikeGLX features and tools that work on sets of run files are affected as follows: FileViewer/Link : To link files in the same run, that is, to show them and scroll them together, you first open any binary file from a run, then choose File/Link in the Viewer window. In the Link dialog you list which other streams in this run to open and link together. This feature only knows how to search for and link other streams that reside in the same parent data-dir/run-folder as the open file. If the multidrive option had split the run, you will only be able to link the streams that live together in one of the split run folders. You'll have to separately view and link data that live in separate data directories. Tools/Sample Rates From Run : This dialog still looks the same. You select any binary file from a run and you have an option to calibrate just that data stream, or all of the streams it can find in the same run folder. If the multidrive option had split the run, this tool will only be able to locate and calibrate probes it can find in the same split run folder as the selected binary. That is, you'll have to repeat this process once for each separate data directory. CatGT : Tell CatGT which probes to process by pointing to a data directory -dir=myDir and listing the probes you want to process, say -prb=0:3 . In CatGT version 1.2.7 and earlier, if any probe is missing from that directory, the run stops and logs a missing file error. As of CatGT version 1.2.8 you can add option -prb_miss_ok telling CatGT to skip missing probes and continue with the next one it finds in that directory. Note that you will have to make a separate command line for each data directory, but each command line can conveniently list all of the probes in the run. You don't have to figure out the modulo rule for each directory. TPrime : Unaffected. All of the input and outfile files {tostream, fromstream, events} already have independently specified paths. Parsing data by probe The safest and most reliable way to process your data is to use our tools: CatGT Other post-processing tools If you are determined to roll your own parsing code, you will need to identify the type of probe used. Once identified, you can look up probe characteristics and parameters in the published probe table . The metadata key that identifies a probe is its part number imDatPrb_pn . Virtually all meta files later than phase 3A will contain this value. fin","title":"SpikeGLX Output Directories and Files"},{"location":"Help/SpikeGLX_dirs_files/#spikeglx-output-directories-and-files","text":"","title":"SpikeGLX Output Directories and Files"},{"location":"Help/SpikeGLX_dirs_files/#filenames","text":"Filenames are decorated with several indices.","title":"Filenames"},{"location":"Help/SpikeGLX_dirs_files/#gate-and-trigger-indices","text":"All files are created under the control of SpikeGLX gate and trigger modes, which determine when to start writing files.

The set of all (M) directories, including the main one are enumerated [dir-0..dir-M-1] . NI and obx output is always sent to dir-0. Probe-j output is sent to dir-(j modulo M) . Within each dir-k SpikeGLX will create a run folder and applicable probe folders according to the same rules that apply for a single main data directory. A Modulo B means \"take the remainder of dividing integers A/B \". Modulo is often written mod and is written % in C/C++ and Python code. For example, suppose these parameters: dir-0 = D:\\Data dir-1 = E:\\DataB dir-2 = G:\\DataC runname = myRun folder per run is enabled Example output would go here: NI: D:\\Data\\myrun\\myrun_g0_t0.ni.bin(.meta) obx0: D:\\Data\\myrun\\myrun_g0_t0.obx0.obx.bin(.meta) obx1: D:\\Data\\myrun\\myrun_g0_t0.obx1.obx.bin(.meta) Imec0: D:\\Data\\myrun\\myrun_g0_imec0\\myrun_g0_t0.imec0.ap.bin(.meta) Imec3: D:\\Data\\myrun\\myrun_g0_imec3\\myrun_g0_t0.imec3.ap.bin(.meta) Imec4: E:\\DataB\\myrun\\myrun_g0_imec4\\myrun_g0_t0.imec4.ap.bin(.meta) Imec8: G:\\DataC\\myrun\\myrun_g0_imec8\\myrun_g0_t0.imec8.ap.bin(.meta) Note: You can run several OneBox ADC streams, which would be named 'obx0,' 'obx1,' etc. All obx* data are tiny so we put all obx files in the main dir-0 directory.","title":"Multidrive output"},{"location":"Help/SpikeGLX_dirs_files/#new-offline-behaviors","text":"When multidrive output is enabled, a run's files are distributed over several directories. The SpikeGLX features and tools that work on sets of run files are affected as follows: FileViewer/Link : To link files in the same run, that is, to show them and scroll them together, you first open any binary file from a run, then choose File/Link in the Viewer window. In the Link dialog you list which other streams in this run to open and link together. This feature only knows how to search for and link other streams that reside in the same parent data-dir/run-folder as the open file. If the multidrive option had split the run, you will only be able to link the streams that live together in one of the split run folders. You'll have to separately view and link data that live in separate data directories. Tools/Sample Rates From Run : This dialog still looks the same. You select any binary file from a run and you have an option to calibrate just that data stream, or all of the streams it can find in the same run folder. If the multidrive option had split the run, this tool will only be able to locate and calibrate probes it can find in the same split run folder as the selected binary. That is, you'll have to repeat this process once for each separate data directory. CatGT : Tell CatGT which probes to process by pointing to a data directory -dir=myDir and listing the probes you want to process, say -prb=0:3 . In CatGT version 1.2.7 and earlier, if any probe is missing from that directory, the run stops and logs a missing file error. As of CatGT version 1.2.8 you can add option -prb_miss_ok telling CatGT to skip missing probes and continue with the next one it finds in that directory. Note that you will have to make a separate command line for each data directory, but each command line can conveniently list all of the probes in the run. You don't have to figure out the modulo rule for each directory. TPrime : Unaffected. All of the input and outfile files {tostream, fromstream, events} already have independently specified paths.","title":"New offline behaviors"},{"location":"Help/SpikeGLX_dirs_files/#parsing-data-by-probe","text":"The safest and most reliable way to process your data is to use our tools: CatGT Other post-processing tools If you are determined to roll your own parsing code, you will need to identify the type of probe used. Once identified, you can look up probe characteristics and parameters in the published probe table . The metadata key that identifies a probe is its part number imDatPrb_pn . Virtually all meta files later than phase 3A will contain this value. fin","title":"Parsing data by probe"},{"location":"Help/imroTables/","text":"IMRO Table Anatomy IM ec R ead O ut tables are simple text files that describe how to configure each readout channel on an imec probe. Each type of probe may have its own set of parameters to access that type's special features. SpikeGLX has GUI editing tools for each probe type, but sometimes you may want to do something custom. This document shows how to write your own (*.imro) files, at least for NP 1.0 probes, which have straightforward internal site selection rules (each channel can connect to just one bank). You can load your own files using the Load button in the SpikeGLX table editor. Note: When you load your own imro table file, you probably want to select default as your shank map. The default will automatically populate the shank(s) according to your imro table. You'll probably also want to select default for your channel map. The default channel map will order your graphs from the tip of the probe to the top (base) according to your imro table.

The meaning of the subsequent channel entries depends upon the probe type. The table must have an entry for each readout channel, usually 384. Entry values are space-separated. A single linefeed '\\n' terminates the file. Channel Entries By Type Type {0,1020,1030,1100,1120,1121,1122,1123,1200,1300}, NP 1.0-like : Channel ID, Bank number of the connected electrode, Reference ID index, AP band gain, LF band gain, AP hipass filter applied (1=ON) The reference ID values are {0=ext, 1=tip, [2..4]=on-shnk-ref}. The on-shnk ref electrodes are {192,576,960}. Type {21,2003,2004} (NP 2.0, single multiplexed shank) : Channel ID, Bank mask (logical OR of {1=bnk-0, 2=bnk-1, 4=bnk-2, 8=bnk-3}), Reference ID index, Electrode ID (range [0,1279]) Type-21 reference ID values are {0=ext, 1=tip, [2..5]=on-shnk-ref}. The on-shnk ref electrodes are {127,507,887,1251}. Type-2003,2004 reference ID values are {0=ext, 1=gnd, 2=tip}. On-shank reference electrodes are removed from commercial 2B probes. Type {24,2013,2014} (NP 2.0, 4-shank) : Channel ID, Shank ID (with tips pointing down, shank-0 is left-most), Bank ID, Reference ID index, Electrode ID (range [0,1279] on each shank) Type-24 reference ID values are {0=ext, [1..4]=tip[0..3], [5..8]=on-shnk-0, [9..12]=on-shnk-1, [13..16]=on-shnk-2, [17..20]=on-shnk-3}. The on-shnk ref electrodes of any shank are {127,511,895,1279}. Type-2013,2014 reference ID values are {0=ext, 1=gnd, [2..5]=tip[0..3]}. On-shank reference electrodes are removed from commercial 2B probes. Type {2020,2021} (Quad-probe) : Channel ID, Shank ID (with tips pointing down, shank-0 is left-most), Bank ID, Reference ID index, Electrode ID (range [0,1279] on each shank) Quad-base reference ID values are {0=ext, 1=gnd, 2=tip on same shank as electode}. Type 1110 (UHD programmable) : This has a unique header: Type (1110), ColumnMode {0=INNER, 1=OUTER, 2=ALL}, Reference ID index {0=ext, 1=tip}, AP band gain, LF band gain, AP hipass filter applied (1=ON) And 24 entries following the header: Group ID, Bank-A, Bank-B, C Code: Type 0 Default The default for a 3B type-0 probe is to select for each channel: bank=0, ref=0, APgain=500, LFgain=250, APfilter=1. void Default3B() { FILE *fo = fopen( \"Default3B.imro\", \"w\" ); // write the header fprintf( fo, \"(0,384)\" ); // write the rows (r) for( int r = 0; r < 384; ++r ) fprintf( fo, \"(%d 0 0 500 250 1)\", r ); // finish fprintf( fo, \"\\n\" ); fclose( fo ); } C Code: Type 0 Tetrodes Each channel will get the default reference, gain and filter settings {ref=0, APgain=500, LFgain=250, APfilter=1}. Starting at the tip, we'll select a block of four channels by setting them to bank-0. Then we'll skip the next four channels in bank-0 by setting them to bank-1. By repeating this we will create tetrodes that cover banks zero and one. The code will loop over sets of eight channels at a time. So there are 384/8 iterations of the loop. void Tetrodes3B() { FILE *fo = fopen( \"Tetrode_1shank.imro\", \"w\" ); // write the header fprintf( fo, \"(0,384)\" ); // write 8 rows (r) at a time for( int r = 0; r < 384/8; ++r ) { fprintf( fo, \"(%d 0 0 500 250 1)\", 8*r ); fprintf( fo, \"(%d 0 0 500 250 1)\", 8*r+1 ); fprintf( fo, \"(%d 0 0 500 250 1)\", 8*r+2 ); fprintf( fo, \"(%d 0 0 500 250 1)\", 8*r+3 ); fprintf( fo, \"(%d 1 0 500 250 1)\", 8*r+4 ); fprintf( fo, \"(%d 1 0 500 250 1)\", 8*r+5 ); fprintf( fo, \"(%d 1 0 500 250 1)\", 8*r+6 ); fprintf( fo, \"(%d 1 0 500 250 1)\", 8*r+7 ); } fprintf( fo, \"\\n\" ); fclose( fo ); } fin","title":"IMRO Table Anatomy"},{"location":"Help/imroTables/#imro-table-anatomy","text":"IM ec R ead O ut tables are simple text files that describe how to configure each readout channel on an imec probe. Each type of probe may have its own set of parameters to access that type's special features. SpikeGLX has GUI editing tools for each probe type, but sometimes you may want to do something custom. This document shows how to write your own (*.imro) files, at least for NP 1.0 probes, which have straightforward internal site selection rules (each channel can connect to just one bank). You can load your own files using the Load button in the SpikeGLX table editor. Note: When you load your own imro table file, you probably want to select default as your shank map. The default will automatically populate the shank(s) according to your imro table. You'll probably also want to select default for your channel map. The default channel map will order your graphs from the tip of the probe to the top (base) according to your imro table.","title":"IMRO Table

Tips Spread the flex arms : The biggest risk to the probe is touching the iron directly to the leads in the central part of the flex. Avoid that by speading the target arm away from the center. Securely hold the flex so it won't shift while trying to solder. Keep the hot iron away from the center by approaching from the exterior side of the cable. Practice first : If you're at all nervous about doing this right, and who isn't?, then by all means practice soldering some wires or inexpensive resistors onto an old printed circuit board. Next extend your soldering practice to flex cable which doesn't heat as easily as standard printed circuit board. Use a dummy probe if you have one to spare. Get the hang of it first. Maybe somebody else in your lab is just better at it than you are. Make them do it. Buy them a beer after. Use the right wire : Use wire with adequate conductivity like copper or silver. Stainless steel, for example, does not conduct heat very well making it hard to wet with solder. Solder won't stick to it. Validate your choice using a scrap of that wire to see if it heats and melts solder. Use the right solder : Lead is nasty, but quite honestly, you want to use solder with about a 60/40 ratio of tin/lead because it melts and flows at a low enough temperature to prevent damaging the probe. Use the right iron : Use an iron with settable temperature so you can get the joint hot enough but not overheat it. Set it to about 700 F. Also use an iron with switchable tips. You want a tip that is both clean, and appropriately sized to adequately heat the target wire and pad, but nothing else. Make sure the parts are clean : The pad, wire and tip of the iron should be free of oils, plastics or other contaminants. Tin the tip of the iron : (1) Clean the tip: Coat it with solder and immediately wipe it off again using the moistened sponge that comes with the solder station. The tip should look shiny and bright all over. (2) Melt a tiny fresh bead of solder onto the tip, just enough to get heat flowing when you touch it to the joint. Heat the joint, not the solder : Never drip molten solder onto a joint. Heat the joint up so solder flows onto and adheres to the joint as you touch it to the wires. Try not to touch the iron itself, that's cheating. However, sometimes you need to wet the tip a little better by adding a touch more of solder to the iron so it makes better contact. Get it hot enough : It's hot enough when touching solder to the wire makes it melt and flow easily. Yes the probe is expensive and the iron is hot. You'll be super nervous, but you still have to get the connection hot enough to flow the solder or your expensive probe will not work. Keep still while it cools : After removing the iron, the joint and solder will cool in 2 to 3 seconds. Don't move while it cools. If you disturb the work during those few seconds you'll diminish the contact surface area, hence, the conductivity of the joint. fin","title":"Noise: Learn How To Solder"},{"location":"Help/Solder/solder/#noise-learn-how-to-solder","text":"","title":"Noise: Learn How To Solder"},{"location":"Help/Solder/solder/#overview","text":"Imec probes as shipped to you generally meet their noise specs: 6-8 uV RMS .

Examples of streams: Neuropixels probe . The sample clock lives in the headstage . The AP-band data are acquired at nominally 30kHz but actual rates may differ by as much as one Hz. If that probe acquires a separate LF-band, the same clock is used and the LF-band sample rate is exactly 1/12 that of the AP-band. In short each probe, really each headstage, is a separate stream. Onebox ADC channels : An imec Onebox can record from several probes, each of which is a stream, and it can record several analog and digital non-neural channels at ~30303Hz, which we also regard as a stream. This gets its own obx file type. NI device : You can use a NI multifunction/multichannel device to record your non-neural analog and digital (TTL) channels. You'll have several options for setting its sample rate. This is one stream. Actually SpikeGLX lets you run two NI devices of the same model together, one master and one slave, so that they share a common clock, and are thus recorded and treated as a single stream with double the channel capacity. Problem : Generally, data streams each have their own clock, hence, their own nominal sample rate, and run asynchronously. Moreover, sample clock rates will vary with temperature. This makes it necessary and challenging to synchronize (align) events acquired in different streams. Solution : SpikeGLX (plus companion tools CatGT and TPrime ) provide a reliable means of aligning data to sub-millisecond accuracy. Note that the SpikeGLX \"alignment\" process does not entail any resampling or editing of the raw acquired data. Rather it is a scheme for mapping post-analysis event times (seconds, not samples) from one coordinate system to another. This mapping scheme is implemented as follows. A common 1 Hz square wave is recorded in one channel of each data stream throughout the experiment. In offline processing, the rising edges in this \" sync wave \" are paired across streams A & B. Any event (T) occurring in B is no more than one second away from a nearest (preceding) sync wave edge (Eb) in stream B. That edge has a simultaneously occurring matching edge (Ea) in stream A. To map T in stream B to T' in stream A, we simply calculate: T' = T - Eb + Ea. Assuming we can correctly pair sync wave edges, the error on any mapped time is bounded by [1s * rate_error/rate]. For example, if the nominal probe sample rate is 30kHz and the error in that value is 3Hz, then the error in the mapped time would be 0.1ms. Rate error arises when we do not know the actual clock rate. The two largest sources of error are (1) bad/unknown calibration (the largest difference from 30kHz we've seen post calibration is 1Hz), and (2) temperature variation, which we measure to be very small near room temperature: < 0.01Hz/5C. So mapping errors after application of TPrime are typically smaller than 0.1ms. Briefly, the sync-related roles of various components are the following, listed in the order you would organize your workflow: SpikeGLX : Calibrate sample rates Recalibrate rates from run Generate and record runtime sync wave CatGT : Extract tables of sync wave edges Extract tables of non-neural event times Your_favorite_spike_sorter : Extract tables of spike times TPrime : Remap all tables of times to reference stream coordinates The remaining sections cover some how-to tips. SpikeGLX: Clock calibration Do I need it? Calibrating your clocks is useful for these reasons: It's a test of headstage health. The measured rate shouldn't be more than 1Hz different than 30kHz, and if you repeat the measurement, it should remain stable to < 0.1Hz. TPrime should also be used if you plan to publish claims about timing. But if you are just browsing in the FileViewer or eyeballing PSTH plots to roughly see how things line up without the bother of running TPrime, that will work better if all clocks are at least calibrated. TPrime needs to be able to identify pairs of matching edges. If the recorded times of edges in the sync wave are a second or more off, the adjustment may suffer phase error. This could be a problem in a long run where error is cumulative. To estimate the duration, consider that an uncalibrated clock could run as much as 1Hz differently than 30kHz. Then a problem will occur at time T, where 1Hz * T = 30000 or T = 8.3 hours. How to Using the Sync tab in the Configuration dialog, you: select a sync wave source specify for each stream which channels are getting sync wave input check Use next run for calibration (and select a run-length) This configures a special purpose run and does a post-run analysis to count how many samples are actually occurring between edges of the sync wave, and thereby deduces the true sample rate. It reports its results in a dialog for you to accept or reject. If accepted these become saved in a database and are used for subsequent runs of those hardware devices until you decide to do another calibration. Tips You probably don't need to calibrate a given device more than once, but you might as well get a good measurement for that one time. We recommend setting the calibration data collection time to 40 min . SpikeGLX: Recalibration Conditions Even if you never calibrated your sample clocks before, you can still calibrate them after the fact from existing run data if: You were recording the sync wave in each stream you want to calibrate. The run is long enough to get a reasonable estimate, at least 20 min. How to To do this, choose item Sample Rates From Run from the Tools menu and follow the instructions in the dialog. As with a first-time calibration it will show you results that you can accept or not. If you accept you can further choose whether to edit this run's metadata, and whether to update the database and use the new rates going forward. The dialog won't let you select imec LF-band files because their time resolution is too low. Rather, select the partner AP-band file. Both AP and LF metadata will be updated together. Note that the LF rate is exactly 1/12 the AP rate. SpikeGLX: Run with sync How to It's easy to do a run that records the sync waveform. Specify a source/generator of the common sync waveform. You have several options: Select any one of the imec slots. Select your NI multifunction I/O device (SpikeGLX programs its output). Use your own signal generator. Set it for 1 Hz and 50% duty cycle. Feed wires from the source to one channel in each stream. For the PXI based versions, all of the imec modules share the sync signal using the chassis backplane, so only one slot (module) needs a wire connected to its SMA connector, whether it is specified as input or output (source). So you connect a wire to just one (active) module, and all imec probes will automatically record the sync wave. If NI is the source, the Notes field indicates which output terminal to connect. Tell the Sync tab which channels you wired so SpikeGLX can locate the waveform in each stream. For NP 1.0 and later, this signal is hard wired to appear on bit #6 of the last 16-bit word in the stream, the SY channel. File T-zero and length When you are running with sync enabled on the Sync tab, whenever a file-writing trigger event occurs and a new set of files is started, SpikeGLX internally uses the edges to make sure that the files all start at a common wall time. Each file's metadata records the sample index number of the first sample in that file: firstSample . These samples are aligned to each other. Said another way, the files share a common T0. While long files are being written, their alignment may slowly degrade because they are running and recording according to their own clock rates. If the clocks have been calibrated this drift will be a bit smaller, but nothing happens during writing to \"reset\" the alignment. Doing that would entail interpolating or resampling of data, which we do not do. (Note that TPrime corrects times by referencing times to sync edges no matter how long the file is. It's effectively like getting periodic resets throughout the run.) The writing phase for a given set of files (given g, t index) ends when a stop event occurs. Perhaps a writing timer elapses, or a TTL trigger gets a stop signal, or you click the Disable or Stop button. Any such event stops all the streams and closes the files, but the \"right-hand-side\" or \"trailing edges\" of the files are not guaranteed to be perfectly aligned. The files are often quite close to being the same length (metadata item fileTimeSecs ), but this is not controlled. CatGT: Event extraction CatGT can perform several post-processing jobs, singly or in combination: Concatenate a g/t-series of separate trial files (whence the name). Apply tshift, band-pass and CAR filters to neural channels. Edit out saturation artifacts. Extract tables of sync waveform edge times to drive TPrime. Extract tables of any other TTL event times to be aligned with spikes. The extraction features are discussed here. General Starting with version 3.0, CatGT extracts sync edges from all streams by default, unless you specify the -no_auto_sync option (see below). There are five extractors for scanning and decoding nonneural data channels in any data stream. They differ in the data types they operate upon: xa: Finds positive pulses in any analog channel. xd: Finds positive pulses in any digital channel. xia: Finds inverted pulses in any analog channel. xid: Finds inverted pulses in any digital channel. bf: Decodes positive bitfields in any digital channel. The first three parameters of any extractor specify the stream-type, stream-index and channel (16-bit word) to operate on, E.g.: -xa= js,ip,word , <additional parameters> Extractors js (stream-type): NI : js = 0 (any extractor). OB : js = 1 (any extractor). AP : js = 2 (only {xd, xid} are legal). Extractors do not work on LF files. Use the AP-band for sync and event extraction: the higher sample rate improves accuracy. Extractors ip (stream-index) NI : ip = 0 (there is only one NI stream). OB : ip = 0 selects obx0, ip = 7 selects obx7, etc. AP : ip = 0 selects imec0, ip = 7 selects imec7, etc. Extractors word Word is a zero-based channel index. It selects the 16-bit data word to process. word = -1, selects the last word in that stream. That's especially useful to specify the SY word at the end of a OneBox or probe stream. It can also be used for NI streams as shorthand for a trailing digital word. It may be helpful to review the organization of words and bits in data streams in the SpikeGLX User Manual . Extractors positive pulse starts at low baseline (below threshold) has a leading/rising edge (crosses above threshold) (optionally) stays high/deflected for a given duration has a trailing/falling edge (crosses below threshold) Digital TTL signals are in the range [0,5] V, so for the xd case, positive pulses are inherently non-negative. The xa extractor looks for rising edges and it works regardless of the baseline level of the pulse. The two threshold value can be positive or negative. The positive pulse extractors {xa, xd} make text files that report the times (seconds) of the leading edges of matched pulses. Extractors xa Following -xa=js,ip,word , these parameters are required: Primary threshold-1 (V). Optional more stringent threshold-2 (V). Milliseconds duration. If your signal looks like clean square pulses, set threshold-2 to be closer to baseline than threshold-1 to ignore the threshold-2 level and run more efficiently. For noisy signals or for non-square pulses set threshold-2 to be farther from baseline than theshold-1 to ensure pulses attain a desired deflection amplitude. Using two separate threshold levels allows detecting the earliest time that pulse departs from baseline (threshold-1) and separately testing that the deflection is great enough to be considered a real event and not noise (threshold-2). See Fig. 1. Extractors xd Following -xd=js,ip,word , these parameters are required: Index of the bit in the word. Milliseconds duration. Extractors both xa and xd All indexing is zero-based. Milliseconds duration means the signal must remain deflected from baseline for that long. Milliseconds duration can be zero to specify detection of all leading edges regardless of pulse duration. Milliseconds duration default precision (tolerance) is +/- 20% . Default tolerance can be overridden by appending it in milliseconds as the last parameter for that extractor. Each extractor can have its own tolerance. E.g., -xd=js,ip,word,bit,100 seeks pulses with duration in default range [80,120] ms. E.g., -xd=js,ip,word,bit,100,2 seeks pulses with duration in specified range [98,102] ms. A given channel or even bit could encode two or more types of pulse that have different durations, e.g., -xd=0,0,8,0,10 -xd=0,0,8,0,20 scans and reports both 10 and 20 ms pulses on the same line. Each option, say -xd=2,0,384,6,500 , creates an output file whose name reflects the parameters, e.g., run_name_g0_tcat.imec0.ap.xd_384_6_500.txt . The threshold is not encoded in the -xa filename; just word and milliseconds. The -save and -sepShanks options can create new neural binaries derived from a parent probe with index ip1, and these new files are labeled by your provided ip2 indices. However, extraction of nonneural events is performed only on the parent ip1 files. For example, you might split a four-shank probe {0} into four separate shank files {1000,1001,1002,1003} using -sepShanks=0,1000,1001,1002,1003 . The output will contain a single file of extracted sync edges, named for probe-0. The derived neural files all share the same nonneural data so the extractor output files are not replicated. Rather, the fyi file has path entries that connect each derived ip2 index with the parent ip1 extractor output file. The run_ga_fyi.txt file lists the full paths of generated extractor output files. It also lists which extractor files go with any derived (ip2) neural file indices. The files report the times (s) of leading edges of detected pulses; one time per line, \\n line endings. The time is relative to the start of the stream in which the pulse is detected (native time). Extractors inverted pulse starts at high baseline (above threshold) has a leading/falling edge (crosses below threshold) (optionally) stays low/deflected for a given duration has a trailing/rising edge (crosses above threshold) Digital TTL signals are in the range [0,5] V, so for the xid case, inverted pulses are still entiely non-negative. The xia extractor looks for falling edges and it works regardless of the baseline level of the pulse. The two threshold value can be positive or negative. The inverted pulse extractors {xia, xid} make text files that report the times (seconds) of the leading edges of matched pulses. The inverted pulse versions work exactly the same way as their positive counterparts. Just keep in mind that inverted pulses have a high baseline level and deflect toward lower values. Extractors bf (bit-field) The -xd and -xid options treat each bit of a digital word as an individual line. In contrast, the -bf option interprets a contiguous group of bits as a non-negative n-bit binary number. The -bf extractor reports value transitions: the newest value and the time it changed, in two separate files. Following -xa=js,ip,word , the parameters are: startbit : lowest order bit included in group (range [0..15]), nbits : how many bits belong to group (range [1..<16-startbit>]). inarow : a real value has to persist this many samples in a row (1 or higher). In the following examples we set inarow=3: To interpret all 16 bits of NI word 5 as a number, set -bf=0,0,5,0,16,3. To interpret the high-byte as a number, set -bf=0,0,5,8,8,3. To interpret bits {3,4,5,6} as a four-bit value, set -bf=0,0,5,3,4,3. You can specify multiple -bf options on the same command line. The words and bits can overlap. Each -bf option generates two output files, named according to the parameters (excluding inarow), for example: run_name_g0_tcat.nidq.bfv_5_3_4.txt . run_name_g0_tcat.nidq.bft_5_3_4.txt , The two files have paired entries. The bfv file contains the decoded values, and the bft file contains the time (seconds from file start) that the field switched to that value. Extractors inarow option The pulse extractors {xa,xd,xia,xid} use edge detection. By default, when a signal crosses from low to high, it is required to stay high for at least 5 samples. Similarly, when crossing from high to low the signal is required to stay low for at least 5 samples. This requirement is applied even when specifying a pulse duration of zero, that is, it is applied to any edge. This is done to guard against noise. You can override the count giving any value >= 1. Extractors no_auto_sync option Starting with version 3.0, CatGT automatically extracts sync edges from all streams unless you turn that off using -no_auto_sync . For an NI stream, CatGT reads the metadata to see which analog or digital word contains the sync waveform and builds the corresponding extractor for you, either -xa=0,0,word,thresh,0,500 or -xd=0,0,word,bit,500 . For OB and AP streams, CatGT seeks edges in bit #6 of the SY word, as if you had specified -xd=1,ip,-1,6,500 and/or -xd=2,ip,-1,6,500 . TPrime: Remapping General After recording, spike sorting, TTL extraction...Now you need to convert all these times from the native timelines of the data streams in which they were measured to a common reference timeline. That's the only way you can compare them! That's what TPrime does. TPrime uses three types of files: tostream : The reference stream we will map to. It is defined by a file of sync wave edges as extracted by CatGT. There is only one of these. fromstream : A native stream we will map from. There can be several of these. A fromstream is identified by a file of sync wave edges extracted by CatGT, and, an arbitrary positive integer that is a shorthand for that stream, just so you don't have to type the edge-file-path over and over. events file : These are times you want to convert. Typically you will have a different file for every event class, such as all the spikes from probe zero, or all the nose_poke times from the NI stream. On the command line for each such file you will specify the stream index for the matching fromstream, an input file of native times, a new file path for the output times. Events files Key specs for events files: Input and output file type can be .txt or .npy (Kilosort). You can mix types: txt in, npy out, etc. Times are seconds, they are not sample numbers . Times are relative to the start of the file. Times are in ascending order. Worked example Outline Here we'll show actual command lines for CatGT and TPrime. We'll use a very simple contrived experiment for concreteness. Two probes {0,1}. Two non-neural NI signals {go_cue, nose_poke}.

Examples of streams: Neuropixels probe . The sample clock lives in the headstage . The AP-band data are acquired at nominally 30kHz but actual rates may differ by as much as one Hz. If that probe acquires a separate LF-band, the same clock is used and the LF-band sample rate is exactly 1/12 that of the AP-band. In short each probe, really each headstage, is a separate stream. Onebox ADC channels : An imec Onebox can record from several probes, each of which is a stream, and it can record several analog and digital non-neural channels at ~30303Hz, which we also regard as a stream. This gets its own obx file type. NI device : You can use a NI multifunction/multichannel device to record your non-neural analog and digital (TTL) channels. You'll have several options for setting its sample rate. This is one stream. Actually SpikeGLX lets you run two NI devices of the same model together, one master and one slave, so that they share a common clock, and are thus recorded and treated as a single stream with double the channel capacity. Problem : Generally, data streams each have their own clock, hence, their own nominal sample rate, and run asynchronously. Moreover, sample clock rates will vary with temperature. This makes it necessary and challenging to synchronize (align) events acquired in different streams. Solution : SpikeGLX (plus companion tools CatGT and TPrime ) provide a reliable means of aligning data to sub-millisecond accuracy. Note that the SpikeGLX \"alignment\" process does not entail any resampling or editing of the raw acquired data. Rather it is a scheme for mapping post-analysis event times (seconds, not samples) from one coordinate system to another. This mapping scheme is implemented as follows. A common 1 Hz square wave is recorded in one channel of each data stream throughout the experiment. In offline processing, the rising edges in this \" sync wave \" are paired across streams A & B. Any event (T) occurring in B is no more than one second away from a nearest (preceding) sync wave edge (Eb) in stream B. That edge has a simultaneously occurring matching edge (Ea) in stream A. To map T in stream B to T' in stream A, we simply calculate: T' = T - Eb + Ea. Assuming we can correctly pair sync wave edges, the error on any mapped time is bounded by [1s * rate_error/rate]. For example, if the nominal probe sample rate is 30kHz and the error in that value is 3Hz, then the error in the mapped time would be 0.1ms. Rate error arises when we do not know the actual clock rate. The two largest sources of error are (1) bad/unknown calibration (the largest difference from 30kHz we've seen post calibration is 1Hz), and (2) temperature variation, which we measure to be very small near room temperature: < 0.01Hz/5C. So mapping errors after application of TPrime are typically smaller than 0.1ms. Briefly, the sync-related roles of various components are the following, listed in the order you would organize your workflow: SpikeGLX : Calibrate sample rates Recalibrate rates from run Generate and record runtime sync wave CatGT : Extract tables of sync wave edges Extract tables of non-neural event times Your_favorite_spike_sorter : Extract tables of spike times TPrime : Remap all tables of times to reference stream coordinates The remaining sections cover some how-to tips.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"Help/SyncEdges/Sync_edges/#spikeglx-clock-calibration","text":"","title":"SpikeGLX: Clock calibration"},{"location":"Help/SyncEdges/Sync_edges/#do-i-need-it","text":"Calibrating your clocks is useful for these reasons: It's a test of headstage health. The measured rate shouldn't be more than 1Hz different than 30kHz, and if you repeat the measurement, it should remain stable to < 0.1Hz. TPrime should also be used if you plan to publish claims about timing. But if you are just browsing in the FileViewer or eyeballing PSTH plots to roughly see how things line up without the bother of running TPrime, that will work better if all clocks are at least calibrated. TPrime needs to be able to identify pairs of matching edges. If the recorded times of edges in the sync wave are a second or more off, the adjustment may suffer phase error. This could be a problem in a long run where error is cumulative. To estimate the duration, consider that an uncalibrated clock could run as much as 1Hz differently than 30kHz. Then a problem will occur at time T, where 1Hz * T = 30000 or T = 8.3 hours.","title":"Do I need it?"},{"location":"Help/SyncEdges/Sync_edges/#how-to","text":"Using the Sync tab in the Configuration dialog, you: select a sync wave source specify for each stream which channels are getting sync wave input check Use next run for calibration (and select a run-length) This configures a special purpose run and does a post-run analysis to count how many samples are actually occurring between edges of the sync wave, and thereby deduces the true sample rate.

Milliseconds duration default precision (tolerance) is +/- 20% . Default tolerance can be overridden by appending it in milliseconds as the last parameter for that extractor. Each extractor can have its own tolerance. E.g., -xd=js,ip,word,bit,100 seeks pulses with duration in default range [80,120] ms. E.g., -xd=js,ip,word,bit,100,2 seeks pulses with duration in specified range [98,102] ms. A given channel or even bit could encode two or more types of pulse that have different durations, e.g., -xd=0,0,8,0,10 -xd=0,0,8,0,20 scans and reports both 10 and 20 ms pulses on the same line. Each option, say -xd=2,0,384,6,500 , creates an output file whose name reflects the parameters, e.g., run_name_g0_tcat.imec0.ap.xd_384_6_500.txt . The threshold is not encoded in the -xa filename; just word and milliseconds. The -save and -sepShanks options can create new neural binaries derived from a parent probe with index ip1, and these new files are labeled by your provided ip2 indices. However, extraction of nonneural events is performed only on the parent ip1 files. For example, you might split a four-shank probe {0} into four separate shank files {1000,1001,1002,1003} using -sepShanks=0,1000,1001,1002,1003 . The output will contain a single file of extracted sync edges, named for probe-0. The derived neural files all share the same nonneural data so the extractor output files are not replicated. Rather, the fyi file has path entries that connect each derived ip2 index with the parent ip1 extractor output file. The run_ga_fyi.txt file lists the full paths of generated extractor output files. It also lists which extractor files go with any derived (ip2) neural file indices. The files report the times (s) of leading edges of detected pulses; one time per line, \\n line endings. The time is relative to the start of the stream in which the pulse is detected (native time).","title":"Extractors both xa and xd"},{"location":"Help/SyncEdges/Sync_edges/#extractors-inverted-pulse","text":"starts at high baseline (above threshold) has a leading/falling edge (crosses below threshold) (optionally) stays low/deflected for a given duration has a trailing/rising edge (crosses above threshold) Digital TTL signals are in the range [0,5] V, so for the xid case, inverted pulses are still entiely non-negative. The xia extractor looks for falling edges and it works regardless of the baseline level of the pulse. The two threshold value can be positive or negative. The inverted pulse extractors {xia, xid} make text files that report the times (seconds) of the leading edges of matched pulses.

Following -xa=js,ip,word , the parameters are: startbit : lowest order bit included in group (range [0..15]), nbits : how many bits belong to group (range [1..<16-startbit>]). inarow : a real value has to persist this many samples in a row (1 or higher). In the following examples we set inarow=3: To interpret all 16 bits of NI word 5 as a number, set -bf=0,0,5,0,16,3. To interpret the high-byte as a number, set -bf=0,0,5,8,8,3. To interpret bits {3,4,5,6} as a four-bit value, set -bf=0,0,5,3,4,3. You can specify multiple -bf options on the same command line. The words and bits can overlap.

However, the converting circuits (ADCs) are expensive in power and real estate, so there are only a few dozen on the probe and they are shared by the ~384 channels. The channels are organized into multiplex channel groups that are digitized together, consequently each group's actual sampling time is slightly offset from that of other groups. CatGT automatically applies an operation we call tshift to undo the effects of multiplexing by temporally aligning channels to each other. This improves the results of operations that compare or combine different channels, such as global CAR filtering or whitening. The FFT-based correction method was proposed by Olivier Winter of the International Brain Laboratory.

Middle: Raw traces zoomed-in; 1 ms time span. Right: Aligned by CatGT tshift; 1 ms time span. Artifact Corrections {CAR, Gfix} CAR (CatGT -gblcar option) Global common average referencing (CAR) calculates (for each sample) the average over all channels, and then subtracts that from each channel. This does a great job of cancelling artifacts that are indeed similar on all channels and that haven't saturated on any channels. Zeroing (CatGT -gfix option) Sometimes the hardware experiences a large electrical insult that affects all channels in a nonuniform way. This may arise from licking, chewing, head banging or laser stimulation events. In these cases CAR won't work as well. CatGT can detect these events and replace them with zeros. This option is specified, for example, as follows: -gfix=0.40,0.10,0.02 . This requires that a transient artifact must attain a peak amplitude of at least ||0.40 mV||, must reach its peak as least as rapidly as ||0.1mV/sample-tick||, and the transient is over when the amplitude settles back to ||0.02 mV|| or smaller. These values are easy to read by inspecting examples with the SpikeGLX FileViewer. Furthermore, at least 25% of the channels must show a transient with these characteristics. Such timepoints are flagged. After all other filtering has been applied, the data are edited to replace the artifact span with zeros in all channels. It does make sense to use -gblcar and -gfix options together. Editing removes extreme artifacts completely, while CAR removes common background noise at all timepoints, not just at extrema.

Right: -gblcar -gfix; All artifacts removed. What is global demux (gbldmx)? The CatGT gbldmx option separates the channels into groups that are sampled concurrently so suffer no time shifts within the group. CAR is then performed on a group by group basis which has advantages and disadvantages compared to doing (tshift + gblcar). Disadvantages: Because the number of channels in a multiplex group is small the averages are noisier than we can achieve by tshifting all channels into one large group and applying CAR after that. Outlier channels have a stronger biasing effect with smaller sample sizes. The correction factors tend to be larger (small channel count in denominator) than with CAR, and that can produce overcorrection artifacts that look like spikes (often small inverted spikes). When to use gbldmx: The probe sampling rate is 30 kHz, so noise faster than 15 kHz is not adequately sampled, and therefore, not accurately propagated to other channel groups by the tshift operation. So for very fast noise artifacts, gbldmx may produce better cancellation within each subsampling group. gbldmx usually outperforms gblcar when tshift is omitted. You may want to omit tshift in CatGT, using the -no_tshift option, if tshift will be applied by some later component in your analysis pipeline. What is local CAR (loccar)? CatGT offers the option to do local CAR over a ring of channels. The idea is that for each channel a disk is used to average the signal of neighbor channels, but an inner disk (containing a potential spike footprint) is excluded from the average. You get to specify the inner and outer disk radii in units of channels. The downsides to this are: Its hard to tune the disk sizes to the actual spike footprints, especially if the probe spans several brain regions with different characteristic neuron sizes, and considering that neurons are at a variety of distances from the probe. Although loccar appears to have good noise reduction, more often than not the true spike amplitude is more severely attenuated because the footprint is larger than you expect. When to use loccar: If background is not uniform over the whole probe. If the probe spans dissimilar brain regions, you may do better averaging more locally. Try setting a fairly large outer radius to balance locality vs smoothness. What about LFP? Tshift is valuable for aligning LFP channels. CAR is not recommended when analyzing low frequencies: LFP varies slowly over the whole shank, making distant channels a bad reference for correcting noise. fin","title":"CatGT: Tshift, CAR, Gfix"},{"location":"Help/catgt_tshift/catgt_tshift/#catgt-tshift-car-gfix","text":"","title":"CatGT: Tshift, CAR, Gfix"},{"location":"Help/catgt_tshift/catgt_tshift/#tshift","text":"Imec probes digitize the voltages on all of their channels during each sample period (~ 1/(30kHz)).
